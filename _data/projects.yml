    title: Convalescence
    summary: <p><i> Recovering from a mysterious accident, Joss seals himself off from the world, turning to astronomy and living out his life in an observatory. But when he makes an important discovery, his perceptions of reality, and his own past, begin to change into something he can hardly recognise.
      
      <br> <br> Convalescence is a voyage into the unknown - whether it be through a telescope or under our very noses. </i> </p>

      - title: Going viral on Tiktok
        description: While procrastinating from my PhD, I got carried away and spent a day writing [a program](https://github.com/codebyzeb/wordleguesser) to find the best first word in Wordle. This was in January 2022, when the wordle craze was at an all-time high. A few days later, I saw people were making TikToks about their best first words and so I decided to hop on the trend with the help of my little program. The video went viral and now has over 1.3M views! 


          I think the virality was due to a combination of good timing, high engagement (lots of comments from people telling me _their_ favourite first word) and an interesting concept! I also got 2500 followers, more than I'd ever managed to get on Youtube. It was amazing to see people get excited about how Computer Science and Linguistics can be applied to solve this puzzle :)

        description: This film was created as an entry to the Film at Jesus Competition. It was written and directed by Adedamola Laoye, who also plays the protagonist. We shot it in a few hours at the Corpus Playroom in Cambridge using a camera on a gimble for most of the shots (cinematography by Jedrek Koh Wei Ze). I recorded the sound and used the theatre lights to light the shoot, as well as help to come up with the shots (in collaboration with everyone else). 
          The film won in its category and overall and was later selected for both [Downing Shorts](https://www.dow.cam.ac.uk/events/downing-shorts-film-festival) and the [Mono Box Short Film Showcase](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cgbwbw_IyZ8/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=).
